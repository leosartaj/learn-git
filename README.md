## Learn Git

Inspired from [git-sandbox](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/git-sandbox)

This is a place to practice git. 

- **Learn to use git**:
  - Go through the try git tutorial at https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
  - Read the first two chapters of the book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Your first exercise is to add your name to this list. To complete this exercise you need to:

- **Fork the repo, create a new branch, make changes and send a pull request**
  - [This article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should give you a good idea of what pull requests are how to use them.
  - A step by step guide can be found [here](https://github.com/asmeurer/git-workflow).
  - This file is written in the Markdown format. Learn about it from [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Get [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

Your entry should maintain alphabetic order and it should be in the format:

`* your name [username](http://github.com/username)`. 

Lines starting with `*` are automatically rendered as bullet points and phrases containing `[name](URL)` are automatically hyperlinked.
